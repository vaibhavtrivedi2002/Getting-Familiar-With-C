Welcome to the C Programming Repository! This repository contains various C programs and projects that demonstrate the key features and capabilities of the C programming language.

## Key Features of C

1. **Procedural Language**: C follows a procedural programming paradigm, which means it relies on functions and procedures to perform tasks.
2. **Low-Level Access**: C provides low-level access to memory through pointers, making it suitable for system programming.
3. **Efficient and Fast**: C is known for its performance and efficiency, making it ideal for developing operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.
4. **Portable**: C code can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal modifications.
5. **Rich Library Support**: C has a vast standard library that provides numerous built-in functions for various tasks.

## Applications of C

C is widely used in various domains, including:

- **System Programming**: Operating systems, device drivers, and system utilities.
- **Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers, IoT devices, and real-time systems.
- **Game Development**: Game engines and performance-critical game components.
- **Compilers and Interpreters**: Development of compilers and interpreters for other programming languages.
- **Scientific Computing**: Numerical computations and simulations.
